## Objective

Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols using Wireshark on Kali Linux.

## Tools Used

- **Wireshark**: A free packet analyzer for capturing and analyzing network traffic.

## Steps Performed

1. Installed Wireshark and launched it on an active network interface.
2. Generated traffic by browsing a website and pinging a server.
3. Captured packets for \~1 minute and saved the file.
4. Filtered packets to identify HTTP, DNS, and TCP protocols.
5. Documented findings in a report.

## Files Included

- `network_capture.pcapng`: The captured packet file for analysis.
- `analysis_report.txt`: Summary of identified protocols and packet details.

## Key Learnings

- Learned to use Wireshark for packet capture and filtering.
- Identified key protocols (HTTP, DNS, TCP) and their roles.
- Understood basic network traffic analysis techniques.

## Challenges

- Ensured sufficient traffic generation within the time limit.

## Acknowledgments

- **Elevate Cybersecurity Internship**: For this learning opportunity.
